# Quiz 101 - A single screen quiz app

Project as a part of nano-degree at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

### Project Rubic

The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice. We want you to be creative about how you accomplish this. Itâ€™s up to you what the quiz questions will be about and how you want to present them to your user. (We recommend about 5-10 quiz questions for a reasonable scope of your app).

#### Helpers :smiley:

- Email Intent
- Radio buttons
- EditText views
- CheckBox
- XML vectors for buttons
